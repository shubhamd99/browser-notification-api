# Web Vitals 

Web Vitals is an initiative by Google to provide unified guidance for quality signals that are essential to delivering a great user experience on the web. Google has provided a number of tools over the years to measure and report on performance. Some developers are experts at using these tools, while others have found the abundance of both tools and metrics challenging to keep up with.

# React Strict Mode

StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. StrictMode currently helps with:

1. Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles
2. Warning about legacy string ref API usage
3. Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
4. Detecting unexpected side effects
5. Detecting legacy context API
